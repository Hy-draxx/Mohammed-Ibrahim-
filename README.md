GIT OVERVIEW
First of all, GIT is an open source platform where millions of people manage their projects. 
Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in a code or file when cooking a project .
It is designed for coordinating work among developers , 
but it can be used to track changes in any set of files or codes.
Its advantages are....high speed, accuracy, and effective efficiency. 

LOCATIONS OF GIT
Also also learned git locations, it has a working tree, staging area, local repository and remote repository. 
The working tree is the location on your computer that contains the directories and files of a single commit.
The staging area contains a list of files that are planned to be included in the next commit that you make. 
The local repository contains all of the commits that have been made for the project. 
The 3 contents above represent the directory repository. 
The remote repository is usually located in a data center or in the cloud.
The remote repository contains the commits of the project, and is often considered the source of truth or official state of the project.



To create a local repository using Sourcetree, 
select New, then Create Local Repository. 
You will then be asked to specify the destination path and name of the local repository. 
The destination path specifies the project directory.
